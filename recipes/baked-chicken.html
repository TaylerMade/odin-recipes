    <h2>A recipe perfect for simple weeknights at home.</h2>

    <p>For this baked Caesar chicken recipe, chicken breast is coated in a creamy dressing and sprinkled with buttery Parmesan topping resulting in crispy, juicy chicken.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup Caesar salad croutons, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (1 1/2 to 2 pounds total)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup creamy Caesar salad dressing</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all purpose flour</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley to taste for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart baking dish with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>Combine crushed croutons, Parmesan cheese, and butter; toss to mix. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Pound to an even thickness with a meat mallet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with pepper and salt on both sides and place chicken into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Stir together salad dressing, sour cream, and flour in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Spoon salad dressing mixture over chicken and turn to coat.</li>
        <li>Top with crouton mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and chicken is longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
